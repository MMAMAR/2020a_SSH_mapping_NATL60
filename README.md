## Motivation

The goal is to investigate how to best reconstruct sequences of Sea Surface Height (SSH) maps from partial satellite altimetry observations. This data challenge follows an _Observation System Simulation Experiment_ framework: "Real" full SSH are from a numerical simulation with a realistic, high-resolution ocean circulation model: the reference simulation. Satellite observations are simulated by sampling the reference simulation based on realistic orbits of past, existing or future altimetry satellites. A baseline reconstruction method is provided (see below) and the practical goal of the challenge is to beat this baseline according to scores also described below and in Jupyter notebooks.

### Reference simulation
The reference simulation is the NATL60 simulation based on the NEMO model (Ajayi et al. 2020 doi:[0.1029/2019JC015827](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JC015827)). The simulation is run without tidal forcing. 

### Observations
The SSH observations include simulations of Topex-Poseidon, Jason 1, Geosat, Envisat, and SWOT altimeter data. No observation error is considered in this challenge.

### Data sequence and use
 
The SSH reconstructions are assessed over the period from 2012-10-22 to 2012-12-02: 42 days, which is equivalent to two SWOT cycles in the SWOT science phase orbit.
For reconstruction methods that need a spin-up, the **observations** can be used from 2012-10-01 until the beginning of the evaluation period (21 days). This spin-up period is not included in the evaluation. For reconstruction methods that need learning from full fields, the **reference data** can be used from 2013-01-02 to 2013-09-30. The reference data between 2012-12-02 and 2013-01-02 should never be used so that any learning period or other method-related-training period can be considered uncorrelated to the evaluation period.

## Quick start
You can follow the quickstart guide in [this notebook](https://github.com/ocean-data-challenges/2020a_SSH_mapping_NATL60/blob/master/quickstart.ipynb) or lauch it directly from <a href="https://binder.pangeo.io/v2/gh/ocean-data-challenges/2020a_SSH_mapping_NATL60/master?filepath=quickstart.ipynb" target="_blank">binder</a>.

## Download the data
The data is hosted [here](https://ige-meom-opendap.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/thredds/catalog/meomopendap/extract/ocean-data-challenges/dc_data1/catalog.html) with the following directory structure

```
. 
|-- dc_obs
|   |-- tpn
|        |-- BOOST-SWOT_TPN_nadir_c*_p*.nc
|   |-- swot
|        |-- BOOST-SWOT_SWOT_nadir_GULFSTREAM_c*_p*.nc
|   |-- j1
|        |-- BOOST-SWOT_SWOT_J1_nadir_c*_p*.nc
|   |-- g2
|        |-- BOOST-SWOT_SWOT_G2_nadir_c*_p*.nc
|   |-- en
|        |-- BOOST-SWOT_SWOT_EN_nadir_c*_p*.nc
|-- dc_ref
|   |-- NATL60-CJM165_GULFSTREAM_y****m**d**.1h_SSH.nc

```

To start out download the *observation* dataset (dc_obs, 285M) using : 
```shell
wget https://ige-meom-opendap.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/thredds/fileServer/meomopendap/extract/ocean-data-challenges/dc_data1/dc_obs.tar.gz
```

and the *reference* dataset (dc_ref, 11G) using (*this step may take several minutes*) : 

```shell
wget https://ige-meom-opendap.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/thredds/fileServer/meomopendap/extract/ocean-data-challenges/dc_data1/dc_ref.tar.gz
```
and then uncompress the files using `tar -xvf <file>.tar.gz`. You may also use `ftp`, `rsync` or `curl`to donwload the data.  


## Baseline and evaluation

### Baseline
The baseline mapping method is optimal interpolation (OI), in the spirit of the present-day standard for DUACS products provided by AVISO. OI is implemented in the [`baseline_oi`](https://github.com/ocean-data-challenges/2020a_SSH_mapping_NATL60/blob/master/notebooks/baseline_oi.ipynb) Jupyter notebook. The SSH reconstructions are saved as a NetCDF file in the `results` directory. The content of this directory is git-ignored.
   
### Evaluation

The evaluation of the mapping methods is based on the comparison of the SSH reconstructions with the *reference* dataset. It includes two scores, one based on the Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE), the other based on Fourier wavenumber spectra. The evaluation notebook [`example_data_eval`](https://github.com/ocean-data-challenges/2020a_SSH_mapping_NATL60/blob/master/notebooks/example_data_eval.ipynb) implements the computation of these two scores as they could appear in the leaderboard. The notebook also provides additional, graphical diagnostics based on RMSE and spectra.

## Data processing

Cross-functional modules are gathered in the `src` directory. They include tools for regridding, plots, evaluation, writing and reading NetCDF files. The directory also contains a module that implements the baseline method.
